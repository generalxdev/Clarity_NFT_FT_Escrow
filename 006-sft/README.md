### Semi Fungible Tokens

Semi-Fungible Tokens, or SFTs, are digital assets that sit between fungible and non-fungible tokens. They are documented in SIP-013, but this is not yet part of official Stack SIPs. Initial proposal can be found [here](https://github.com/MarvinJanssen/sips/blob/feat/sip-013/sips/sip-013/sip-013-semi-fungible-token-standard.md).

Reference implementation is also provided [here](https://github.com/MarvinJanssen/stx-semi-fungible-token).

Write a contract to demonstrate use of SFTs.
